# Green-Reader 2000

In my project I want to make a tool that can look at an image of golf greens and give the contour of the green in such a way that a golfer can look at, and get help with reading putts to ultimately make them better at golf. I am motivated for the project as I love the game of golf and I am always looking for ways that I can get better at the game and see this project as an opportunity to do extensive research in order to improve me game, we well as anyone else who would be interested. The ideal outcome would look like some tool that can successfully provide the user with the green and the slope and provide them with a proper line to start the putt on with a goal to improve the make percentage of putts throughout a golf round.
